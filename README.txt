Summary: 
My Project is going to tell the story of how Mario Lemieux saved the Pittsburgh Penguins from bankruptcy and relocation. The story will focus on what Lemieux, with the help of his investing business partners, did to save the team, along with his history before he was in a position to save the team. I am also going to talk about how much the salvation of the team meant to the city, who was very passionate about the Penguins. I will also look at the events that transpired after the team was saved (3 Stanley Cup championships), which would have never happened without Lemieux.
